Integer : add Integer first, Integer second
    -> first + second

i = 5                 //Integer i
k = 2                 //Integer k

print add i , k       //prints 7

#                   
i = 6;
printf("%d \n", add_$_Integer_$_Integer( i , k ) );  //prints 8
#                   

print add i , k     //prints 8 as well since 'i' was changed at the source
